# Leaflet Local Fallback

This folder should contain a local copy of Leaflet for fallback purposes.

Download these files from https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/ and place them here:
- leaflet.css
- leaflet.js
- images/ (folder with Leaflet marker images)

This ensures your maps will work even if CDN is unavailable.
